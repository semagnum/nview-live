If this addon has helped you and improved your workflow, I am glad to hear it!
This addon will remain free and open source. If you want to say thank you and
communicate your desire for continued development on this addon, consider
doing any of the following:

## Report Bugs {#report-bugs}
This helps me resolve issues for you as well as your fellow Blender artists.
An error report should ideally include three things:

#### The error message(s).
You can get the full console output including the error message
by clicking "Window" and then "Toggle System Console" at the top of the Blender window.
If there are no error messages to find, share the expected behavior, screenshots,
or a Blender file to show what actually happened.

#### Your version of Blender.
You can get this from the Blender splash screen upon opening Blender
or by clicking the Blender icon at the top of the window and
selecting "About Blender."

#### Your version of nView Live.
You can find this under nView Live in the addon preferences.
Use the latest version of the addon to validate that
the issue still exists in the code.

Once you have these,
[open an issue on GitHub](https://github.com/{{site.github_username}}/nview-live/issues/new).
Be sure to check if others have reported the same issue!

## Contribute Code {#contribute-code}

You can fork the code via Github and make pull requests for me to review - 
preferably for open issues, but pull requests are a great way
to visualize suggested features.
I will review pull requests to ensure changes match addon expectations,
the issue it's resolving, and the code standards set
for the sake of future contributors.

If changes affect documentation, please include changes to
the documentation in the pull request as well.
I follow PyCharm's standard PEP8 conventions as well as SonarLint's
standard rules for Python.

## Donate {#donate}

It is not required, but I deeply appreciate any financial contributions.
This does take lots of my time and effort to ensure this is
a useful, well-marketed addon for you.
